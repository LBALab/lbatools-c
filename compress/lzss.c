   The changes were done by Miran Grƒça (Battler).

/************************** Start of LZSS.C ************************
 *
 * This is the LZSS module, which implements an LZ77 style compression
 * algorithm.  As iplemented here it uses a 12 bit index into the sliding
 * window, and a 4 bit length, which is adjusted to reflect phrase lengths
 * of between 2 and 17 bytes.
 *
 * Various constants used to define the compression parameters.  The
 * INDEX_BIT_COUNT tells how many bits we allocate to indices into the
 * text window.  This directly determines the WINDOW_SIZE.  The
 * LENGTH_BIT_COUNT tells how many bits we allocate for the length of
 * an encode phrase. This determines the size of the look ahead buffer.
 * The TREE_ROOT is a special node in the tree that always points to
 * the root node of the binary phrase tree.  END_OF_STREAM is a special
 * index used to flag the fact that the file has been completely
 * encoded, and there is no more data.  UNUSED is the null index for
 * the tree. MOD_WINDOW() is a macro used to perform arithmetic on tree
 * indices.
